# Nom Fun

This is really just a chance to play around with rust.  At one point I
figured I'd dive into nom and write a
[fit](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/) parser, because it's a binary
format and although I've dinked around with text parser combinators, I haven't
played around with binary ones. However, since I'm still exceedingly new to
rust, I find myself taking many detours along the way to help solidify my
nascent knowledge.  As such, from an outside perspective there may not be
any apparent rhyme or reason as to what I'm doing at any time.

One thing that I've tended to do when I've worked on solo projects is
to put a TODO file somewhere&mdash;typically at the root or within
`doc`&mdash;and then later (especially if I share my project with others)
add issues.  This time I'm going to forgo the TODO file and go straight
with issues, even though I'm the only one with access to this project.
